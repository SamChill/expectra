# Expectra

## Introduction

Expectra is program to simulate EXAFS from the outputs of molecular
dynamics simulations. It also has the ability to to sample structures
based on a harmonic potential generated from a normal modes calculation.

The EXAFS multiple scattering calculations are performed using
[FEFF6-lite][feff], which was written at the University of Washington by J.J.
Rehr and co-workers.<sup>1</sup>

## Requirements

* gfortran
* MPI (e.g. OpenMPI or MPICH)
* Python
  * numpy
  * mpi4py

## Installation

This program is distributed as a Python package. It requires a Fortran
compiler (e.g. gfortran) to build the FEFF6-lite program that is redistributed with the code. A MPI library (e.g. OpenMPI) is also required.

The first step is to install Python, GFortran, and MPICH. On Ubuntu this can be accomplished like so:

```
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential gfortran mpich python python-pip
```

Once the dependencies are installed expectra (and the Python packages it
depends on) can be installed using pip:

```
$ pip install --user expectra
```

## Usage

```

  --first-shell         a single scattering calculation that uses an
                        automatically calculated reference path (default:
                        True)
  --neighbor-cutoff DISTANCE
                        1st neighbor cutoff distance (default: 3.4)

  --ignore-elements ELEMENTS
                        comma delimited list of elements to ignore in the
                        scattering calculation
  --edge EDGE           one of K, L1, L2, L3
  --skip SKIP           number of frames to skip at the beginning
